## Hi there, I am Jean Heckel 👋

I am currently studying a first year of master's degree Scientific Computation and Mathematics of Innovation at the University of Strasbourg.

## About Me
I am developping strong skills in Scientific Computing, High Perfomance Computing (MPI, Kokkos, OpenMP and OpenCL), Image and Signal Processing and Optimisation and IA.
I recently worked on the numerical simulation of a fin‑based cooling system for microprocessors, using Finite Difference Method and linear interpolation to compute the solution in 3D.


## Looking for an intership
  🤔 I’m looking for an internship in the field of Scientific Computing for a two-months period.
